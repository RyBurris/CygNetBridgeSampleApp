# Sample

The CygNet Bridge API comes with a sample web application providing source code that demonstrates using the API to retrieve data from your CygNet system. The sample application source code is located in the Bridge delivery in the folder BridgeAPISampleApp/sample. The source code is for an Angular web application and needs to be compiled first in order to run it in a web browser.  
 
## Angular

 To build the application you will need to install the Angular CLI which is a tool for creating, developing, and maintaining Angular applications.  
Instructions for installing angular can be found at https://angular.io/ 

## Installation

Open a Windows command prompt to the “sample” folder, and type the command: 
“npm install” - This will download and install all of the required dependencies. 
Next enter the command: 
“npm start” – This will compile the application and start a test development server on port 4200. 
To test the application, open a web browser to the address: http://localhost:4200 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
